how to make a triangle button in qml

see the example-use.qml for a simple example.

here it is used in an Andoid style back button.

you can make it fill up the inside, or leave it as outline only.
Or have it filled in when the button gets pushed.

it looks like:
![outline  fill=false](https://raw.github.com/clogwog/qml-triangle/master/screenshot_01.jpg)
